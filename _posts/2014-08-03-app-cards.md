While Tinker was nearing the final stages of development, thoughts concerning how we could share what we've made with others started to come to mind. We immediately thought of handing out cards to those we met and already knew. The focus of these cards would be the promo code on the back, giving those who've received one early access to Tinker. To do this, Tinker had to be accepted before allowing others to use it - which it was. The only problem we faced was putting the code on the card, which we hadn't realized would become such a hassle until that point was reached.

You see, we wanted the code to be scannable via the iPhone's camera, just like Apple's iTunes cards. Checking Apple's design guidelines, we were surprised to find no documentation on this. Searching Google also led us nowhere. We spent a huge amount of time trying to replicate the stroke size of the box, even down to the exact typeface, font size, and letter spacing of the promo code. After hyper analyzing an iTunes card, we were finally able to replicate the code presentation to be properly recognized by the iPhone's camera.

We designed the card we wanted to distribute in Photoshop, pasting in a different code each time and copying that image to a Pages document with a card layout in two columns of four. We went to the local FedEx shop and had them printed and sliced the day before leaving for WWDC.

Attending WWDC was an amazing experience, and having these cards made gave us an incredible opportunity at showing others what we've been working on. We had a huge turn out rate on promo code redemption, and ultimately wanted to share our solution.
