Tinker 1.2 recently hit the App Store. Unbelievable excited? Don't worry, we'll list out the changes here:

- UI improvements.

- Bug fixes regarding 'Cover to pause'.

- New pausing system - we've gotten tons of request to have it so only the goal you tap becomes paused.

- Tap to Start - rather than setting a date, optionaly have a goal activate upon tapping.

- Custom date picker

Apart from bug fixes and minor altercations to the pausing system, the headline features are Tap to Start and a modified date picker. This allows for a bunch more options appended to your goals in future updates. It'll recure to you later.

We're currently working on a super cool iOS 8 update.

Stay friendly.
